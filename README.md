# Arduino HID Firmware

It's recommended to use an Arduino Leonardo R3 (ATMega32U4) since it does not require a separate USB interface.
You can also use a regular UNO board with Hoodloader2 installed.

Hoodloader2 installation guide (do it at your own risk because it overrides the usual bootloader and it is possible that the Arduino breaks during the process):
